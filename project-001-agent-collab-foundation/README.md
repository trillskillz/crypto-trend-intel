# Project 001 — Agent Collaboration Foundation

Goal: Stand up a production-ready collaboration workflow where Builder, Researcher, Ops, Comms, Creative, and QA can execute a shared software project with clear handoffs and fast iteration.

## Success Criteria (v1)
- Shared project structure is active and used by all roles.
- Role-specific task queues exist and are actionable.
- Architecture baseline, delivery plan, and quality gates are defined.
- Daily status and blocker reporting format is standardized.

## Working Agreement
- All cross-role communication goes through `agents/shared/handoffs`.
- Artifacts live under this project folder.
- Decisions must include rationale + owner + timestamp.
