# Project Brief

## Problem
Multi-agent work is configured but needs a concrete execution framework to build consistently and report clearly.

## Scope (Phase 1)
1. Planning and architecture baseline
2. Execution lanes by role
3. QA gates and release checklist
4. Reporting cadence and handoff quality

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Final product-specific feature implementation
- External deployment of customer-facing services
